WE ARE NOW LIVING IN DIFFERENT TIMES, BUT THE SITUATION IS NO LESS CRITICAL THAN THE ONE THAT LED TO THE EMERGENCE OF THE UNITED NATIONS.</p><p>A NEW WORLD WAR HAS BEEN DECLARED BY AN AGGRESSOR THAT DOES NOT RESPECT THE TRADITIONAL RULES OF WAR OR NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY. THE AGGRESSOR IS A PERNICIOUS INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION THAT HAS GREAT POWER AND RESOURCES AND THAT IS NOURISHED BY ILLEGAL REVENUES GENERATED BY DRUG TRAFFICKING.</p><p>AS THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL RECENTLY SAID, AND I QUOTE: THE ILLEGAL USE OF AND TRAFFICKING IN DRUGS TODAY IS SEEN AS A SOCIAL PLAGUE THAT AFFECTS BOTH INDUSTRIALIZED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. ALTHOUGH EFFORTS TO FIGHT THIS SCOURGE HAVE INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS, STATISTICS SHOW THAT THE MONETARY VALUE OF DRUG TRAFFICKING IS GREATER THAN THAT OF THE INTERNATIONAL OIL TRADE AND IS ONLY SURPASSED BY ARMS TRAFFICKING. IT IS CERTAINLY WORRISOME TO SEE THAT MANKIND IS SO DEEPLY INVOLVED IN TRAFFICKING DEGRADATION AND DEATH. END OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL'S STATEMENT.</p><p>THE MEMBERS OF THESE CRIMINAL CARTELS WERE BORN IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES, AND MANY OF THEIR LEADERS ARE BELIEVED TO BE COLOMBIANS. ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE THAT SOME OF THEM MAY HAVE BEEN BORN IN MY COUNTRY, I MUST CLARIFY THAT THEY ARE COLOMBIANS IN NAME ONLY. THEY ARE REALLY JUST INTERNATIONAL FUGITIVES WHO HAVE NO HOME. COLOMBIA IS NOT THEIR HOMELAND! [APPLAUSE]</p><p>I AM ALSO HERE AT THE UNITED NATIONS TO PRESENT TO YOU THE CRUDE REALITY OF THIS WAR AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING. COLOMBIA IS ON THE FRONTLINE OF THIS BATTLE. FOR US IT IS NOT A WAR OF WORDS. MANY COLOMBIANS HAVE DIED BECAUSE OF THEIR FIRM COMMITMENT AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING. APPROXIMATELY 1 MONTH AGO, LUIS CARLOS GALAN, ONE OF THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS POLITICAL LEADERS IN MY COUNTRY, WAS ASSASSINATED. HIS DEATH HAS CONSOLIDATED EVEN MORE THE NATION'S WILL AND HAS DRAWN THE WORLD'S ATTENTION TO THE PROBLEM. HOWEVER, MANY COLOMBIANS HAVE DIED OVER THE YEARS -- AS HE DID -- AS VICTIM OF DRUG TRAFFICKING. THAT LONG LIST INCLUDES 12 MAGISTRATES OF THE SUPREME COURT, AN ATTORNEY GENERAL, AND A JUSTICE MINISTER. PROMINENT CONGRESSMEN, JUDGES, MAYORS, JOURNALISTS, THOUSANDS OF SOLDIERS, POLICEMEN, AND COLOMBIAN CITIZENS HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES FOR DEMOCRACY.</p><p>LAST MONTH, AFTER ANNOUNCING EXCEPTIONAL MEASURES AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, WHICH WERE DECREED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STATE OF SIEGE, DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAVE CONTINUED AND INTENSIFIED THEIR TERRORIST ACTIONS.
