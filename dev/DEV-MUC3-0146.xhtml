THE EMBARGO WAS PARTIALLY LIFTED YESTERDAY.</p><p>PINOCHET SAID THAT THE ANTI-U.S. REACTIONS IN CHILE WERE "UNFAIR" AND REAFFIRMED THAT "THE DUTY OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS TO PROTECT THE POPULATION OF THEIR COUNTRY."</p><p>THE CHILEAN PRESIDENT ALSO HARSHLY CRITICIZED THE OPPOSITION, ESPECIALLY THOSE "WHO ARE UNDERHANDEDLY ACTING AGAINST OUR COUNTRY," CALLING THEM "TURNCOATS."</p><p>PINOCHET ASKED: "HOW MANY OF THEM HAVE GONE TO THE UNITED STATES TO BEG, TO WHINE, AND TO SPREAD TALES IN ORDER TO STOP LOANS TO US? HAS EVERYONE FORGOTTEN THAT THERE IS A GENTLEMAN WHO HAS BEEN ASKING THE UNITED STATES NOT TO GIVE US ANY MORE LOANS?"</p><p>THE CHILEAN PRESIDENT ADMITTED THAT "THE UNITED STATES HAD BEEN ATTACKED" BECAUSE "THEIR INITIAL MEASURE WAS HASTY. IT AMOUNTED TO USING A TANK TO KILL A FLEA. IT WAS A HARSH MEASURE WHICH HAD THE IMMEDIATE RESULT OF STOPPING OUR SHIPMENTS OF FRUIT ABROAD."</p><p>PINOCHET EMPHASIZED, HOWEVER, THAT THE UNITED STATES WAS NOT TO BLAME, BUT RATHER "THOSE WHO HAVE REQUESTED A BOYCOTT AGAINST [WORDS INDISTINCT]."</p></body></html>
