	<description>
		A simple demonstration of fact extraction where knowledge is captured as RDFa for linking to a knowledge base and wider applications. This 
		is a "strawman" that can be used to test and develop the approach. Currently scope-limited to reports from 18th August 1989, and the 
		assassination of Colonel Waldemar Quintero.
