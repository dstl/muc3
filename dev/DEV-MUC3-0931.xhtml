THE ARCHBISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR UNDERLINED THAT THE SITE OF THE INCIDENT "IS AN AREA HIGHLY CONTROLLED BY THE MILITARY," THAT ON THE DAY IN QUESTION "THE CURFEW OR, IN OTHER WORDS, MARTIAL LAW WAS IN EFFECT," AND THAT "THERE IS A MILITARY NEIGHBORHOOD NEAR THE UCA."</p><p>"ALL OF THIS LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE GUERRILLAS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE. THE OPERATION LASTED 1/2 HOUR AND THE UNIFORMED INDIVIDUALS STAYED THERE FOR A GOOD WHILE, 2 OR PERHAPS 3 HOURS. HAD THEY BEEN GUERRILLAS, THEY WOULD HAVE ATTACKED AND FLED IMMEDIATELY," HE ADDED.</p><p>ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS ALSO UNDERSCORED THAT "THEY TOOK THE PRIESTS OUT TO THE GARDEN, MURDERED THEM, EXPLODED DEVICES, BURNED THE HOUSE, AND STAYED AT THE SITE FOR A LONG TIME," WHICH "MEANS THAT THEY FELT SURE OF THEMSELVES."</p><p>THE ARCHBISHOP SAID DURING THE INTERVIEW THAT "IT HAS BEEN FULLY PROVEN" THAT THERE ARE TWO POLITICAL LINES WITHIN THE RULING ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] PARTY: "ONE HEADED BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI, AND ANOTHER MORE RADICAL SECTOR."</p><p>RIVERA Y DAMAS SAID THAT HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE GUERRILLAS HAVE BEEN "ELIMINATED" BY THE ARMY. " THEY HAVE NOT ACCOMPLISHED WHAT THEY WANTED, BUT, HE SAID, THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ELIMINATED, AND THAT IS WHY I STILL BELIEVE THAT THE BEST COURSE IS THAT OF NEGOTIATION."</p><p>REGARDING THE LETTER SENT TO THE POPE BY EL SALVADOR'S ATTORNEY GENERAL, IN WHICH HE ADVISES THE DEPARTURE OF A FEW BISHOPS FROM EL SALVADOR, RIVERA Y DAMAS COMMENTED THAT IN A WAY IT WAS BENEFICIAL BECAUSE "WE HAVE NEVER RECEIVED AS MUCH SOLIDARITY OR SUPPORT AS WE ARE RECEIVING NOW FROM THE SUPREME PONTIFF TO THE EPISCOPAL CONFERENCES."</p><p>RIVERA Y DAMAS ALSO POINTED OUT THAT HE HAS BEEN THREATENED, NOT ONLY BY PHONE BUT BY RADIO.</p></body></html>
