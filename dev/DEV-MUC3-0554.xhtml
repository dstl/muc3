THE PARDON WAS ORDERED WITH THE SIGNING OF SEVERAL DECREES TODAY.</p><p>MENEM TALKED WITH REPORTERS ABOUT THE PARDON. HE SAID: "I CANNOT ESTIMATE WHAT THE POLITICAL COSTS WILL BE. I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THEY WILL BE MANY OR NOT BUT I WILL ASSUME MY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COSTS. WHAT INTERESTS ME IS MY COUNTRY, MY PEOPLE."</p><p>MENEM ADDED: "ACQUITTAL MEANS PARDON, AND FROM NOW ON ALL THOSE WHO RECENTLY VIOLATED HUMAN RIGHTS HAVE BEEN PARDONED."</p><p>MENEM SAID THAT IT IS "BASICALLY" IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US "TO BE ABLE TO BUILD AN ARGENTINA WHERE IT WILL BE WORTH LIVING."
