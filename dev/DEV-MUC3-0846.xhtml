THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S DEMAND FOR A CEASE-FIRE, AS REQUESTED BY THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL AND THE OAS SECRETARY GENERAL, THE GROUP OF EIGHT, THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE EEC, CANADA, THE SOVIET UNION, SWEDEN, AND FINLAND, IS A FAIR DEMAND FOR HUMANITARIAN AND POLITICAL REASONS AND IS AIMED AT STOPPING THE LOSS OF HUMAN LIVES AS WELL AS PREVENTING BLOODLETTING BETWEEN THE TWO SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES;</p><p>2. THE BRUTAL AERIAL AND ARTILLERY ATTACKS HAVE CAUSED MOSTLY CIVILIAN VICTIMS IN THE LOW-INCOME DISTRICTS AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THOUSANDS OF HOMES;</p><p>3. A MANHUNT HAS BEEN UNLEASHED FOR THE LEADERS AND MEMBERS OF TRADE UNIONS, RELIGIOUS AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, AND OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES, WHICH HAS RESULTED IN MURDERS, CAPTURES, SEARCHES, AND PERSECUTION, THE EXTENT OF WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO GAUGE, AND OTHER VICTIMS OF THE PERSECUTION HAVE GONE UNDERGROUND OR LEFT THE COUNTRY, GIVING RISE -- BECAUSE OF THESE ACTIONS PER SE AND THE CONCEALMENT OF TRUTH -- TO A CLIMATE OF STATE TERRORISM;</p><p>4. A POSTPONEMENT OF THE CEASE-FIRE WOULD RESULT IN FURTHER DAMAGE TO THE SALVADORAN POPULATION AND MORE ARMED CONFRONTATIONS, AND THIS WOULD NOT ALLOW CONDITIONS TO BE CREATED TO END THE WAR IN THE CITIES, THE COUNTRYSIDE, AND SAN SALVADOR'S METROPOLITAN AREA;</p><p>5. THERE ARE SECTORS IN THE ARMED FORCES, ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE], PCN [NATIONAL CONCILIATION PARTY], MAC [AUTHENTIC CHRISTIAN MOVEMENT], AND IN THE UNITED STATES THAT WANT A PROLONGATION OF THE WAR AND, THEREFORE, OPPOSE A CEASE-FIRE; AND</p><p>6. WE ARE ACTING WITH FLEXIBILITY, GUIDED BY THE NATION'S PATRIOTIC INTERESTS, THE SITUATION OF TRUE EMERGENCY THAT HAS BEEN CREATED, AND THE DESIRE TO FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE ARMED CONFLICT, AND BECAUSE OF THE SOCIAL, MILITARY, POLITICAL, AND ECONOMIC POLARIZATION, IT IS URGENT THAT ALL FORCES ACT SWIFTLY AND TAKE STEPS TO PUT A DEFINITIVE END TO THE WAR,</p><p>THEREFORE:</p><p>1. WE STATE OUR IMMEDIATE ACCEPTANCE OF A CEASE-FIRE UNDER VERIFICATION BY THE UNITED NATIONS IN RESPONSE TO THE DEMAND OF THE POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND RELIGIOUS FORCES OF THE SALVADORAN NATION AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, WHICH HAVE ADDRESSED US TO PROPOSE IT.
