ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SPOKESMEN, THE TASK IS MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE THE BODIES WERE SCATTERED OVER A RADIUS OF 8 KM. THE PLANE DEPARTED BOGOTA TOWARD CALI, AT 1213 GMT, BUT TWO POWERFUL EXPLOSION BROUGHT IT DOWN AFTER ONLY 5 MINUTES IN THE AIR. BOMB-SQUAD EXPERTS, IN COORDINATION WITH THREE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATORS, HAVE STARTED TO EXAMINE THE SITE TO INVESTIGATE THE ACCIDENT AND DETERMINE WHETHER THE TRAGEDY WAS CAUSED BY A MECHANICAL FAILURE, OR IF IT WAS A TERRORIST ACTION. THE BOGOTA CARACOL NETWORK RECEIVED AN ANONYMOUS CALL FROM THE EXTRADITABLES -- COLOMBIAN DRUG KINGPINS WANTED BY SEVERAL U.S. FEDERAL COURTS -- WHO SAID THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTION. ANOTHER NETWORK REPORTS THAT THE MAN WHO CALLED THE CARACOL NETWORK NEWS OFFICE SAID HE BELONGED TO THE EXTRADITABLES AND THAT THE ACTION WAS CARRIED OUT BECAUSE THERE WERE FIVE INFORMERS ON THE PLANE. THE POLICE HAVE REPORTED THAT THEY ARE INVESTIGATING THE EXPLOSIONS THAT CAUSED THE PLANE TO CRASH SHORTLY AFTER IT LEFT THE BOGOTA EL DORADO AIRPORT TO GO TO CALI.</p></body></html>
