HE ADDED THAT COLOMBIA IS "DIVIDED INTO TWO COUNTRIES: THE LEGAL COUNTRY AND THE ONE RUN BY NARCOTICS." HE SAID, "I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE LEGAL WILL WIN."</p><p>ACCORDING TO DUHALDE WHAT IS TAKING PLACE IN COLOMBIA "CANNOT OCCUR IN ARGENTINA FOR SEVERAL DECADES." HE SAID THAT HE PERSONALLY SUPPORTS THE IDEA OF "SENDING TROOPS TO COLOMBIA IF ITS LEADERS REQUEST THEM." HOWEVER, HE EXPLAINED: "THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT HAS TO BE RESOLVED BY CONGRESS."</p><p>HE POINTED OUT THAT "DRUG TRAFFICKERS ARE UNDOUBTEDLY OPERATING IN THE COUNTRY BUT THEIR NATIONALITIES ARE NOT KNOWN." HE ADDED THAT "THERE IS AN ORGANIZATION THAT DISTRIBUTES THE DRUG IN ARGENTINA."</p><p>DUHALDE SAID: "WHAT IS TAKING PLACE IN COLOMBIA IS A CLEAR EXAMPLE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE CONTINENT -- THE PRODUCTION AND TRAFFICKING OF DRUGS." HE ADDED: "DRUGS ARE NOT PRODUCED IN ARGENTINA. THEY ARE BROUGHT FROM COLOMBIA, BOLIVIA, AND PERU."</p><p>HE SAID: "IN 1988 IN MY BOOK 'POLITICIANS AND DRUGS' I WARNED ABOUT THE CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS CLOSELY LINKED TO TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS SHINING PATH IN PERU AND M-19 IN COLOMBIA."</p><p>DUHALDE INDICATED THAT "THE STRUGGLE IS AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND THEIR SUPPORTERS. IDEOLOGIES ARE NOT INVOLVED HERE BECAUSE, FOR EXAMPLE, IN COLOMBIA THE TRAFFICKERS ARE OF THE EXTREME RIGHT -- NATIONALISTS."</p><p>HE ADDED THAT "THE DRUG ADDICTION PROBLEM IN ARGENTINA INVOLVES YOUTHS FROM 13 TO 20 YEARS OF AGE" AND THAT THAT IS WHY "PREVENTION MEASURES SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS, WHERE WE SHOULD TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT THE ILLS DRUGS CAUSE."</p><p>DUHALDE, WHO IS GOING TO TOUR THE COUNTRY TO LECTURE ON "HOW TO PREVENT DRUG ADDICTION," SAID THAT "IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO INCLUDE THAT ISSUE IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM, BECAUSE TEACHERS CAN BECOME THE REAL FORCE FOR ENDING DRUG ADDICTION."</p><p>HE REVEALED THAT COCAINE CONSUMPTION IN THE COUNTRY IS COMING CLOSE TO MARIJUANA CONSUMPTION, WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN HIGHER." HE SAID THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO CREATE "VERY HARSH REGULATIONS," SUCH AS THE DEATH PENALTY, "FOR PEOPLE WHO COMMIT HOMICIDES AS THEY ARE DOING IN COLOMBIA."</p><p>REGARDING THE CHAOTIC COLOMBIAN SITUATION, DUHALDE SAID: "DRUG TRAFFICKERS ARE A SORT OF PARALLEL GOVERNMENT THAT AIMS TO TAKE POWER. I BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT THIS WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE EVEN IF THEY HAVE THEIR OWN POLITICIANS, POLICEMEN, TEACHERS, AND OFFICIALS."</p><p>HE SAID: "THIS IS NOT ONLY A COLOMBIAN PROBLEM; IT IS A CONTINENTAL PROBLEM THAT NO ONE CAN SOLVE ALONE, NOT EVEN THE UNITED STATES. THAT IS WHY JOINT ACTION IS NECESSARY TO ELIMINATE THOSE TRAFFICKERS IN DEATH."</p><p>REGARDING HIS RECENT TRIP TO THE UNITED STATES, DUHALDE SAID THAT HIS TALKS "DID NOT INCLUDE POSSIBLE U.S. MILITARY AID TO THE COUNTRIES WITH DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEMS, BECAUSE THE COLOMBIAN SITUATION HAD NOT YET DEVELOPED TO ITS CURRENT STAGE."</p><p>HE CALLED THE COLOMBIAN CARTELS "MAFIA GANGS" THAT ARE "TRYING TO SET UP A DISTRIBUTION NETWORK" FOR THEIR MERCHANDISE WHICH GIVES THEM A PROFIT OF ABOUT $150 BILLION A YEAR ON SALES OF $500 BILLION."</p><p>DUHALDE SAID THAT "THE DRUG LORDS BUY LARGE ENTERPRISES, COMPANIES, BANKS, AND OFFICES. THEY ALSO FORM RELATIONS WITH POLITICIANS AND MILITARY MEN." HE ADDED THAT "THEY HAVE A GREAT ABILITY TO CORRUPT," AND "THEY SETTLE IN ONE PLACE WHEN THEY ARE SURE THEY WILL NOT BE ARRESTED."</p></body></html>
