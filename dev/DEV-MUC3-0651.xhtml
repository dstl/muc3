ONE OF THE DECISIONS ADOPTED DURING THE SESSION WAS TO RECRUIT MINORS, SHANTYTOWN YOUTHS, AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS "TO FIGHT A GUERRILLA WAR IN CHILE, BECAUSE THEY HAVE PLENTY OF MOTIVATION."</p><p>THIS POLICY IS OUTLINED IN DOCUMENTS AND REPORTS THAT THOSE TERRORIST GROUPS HAVE CIRCULATED IN SHANTYTOWNS AND AMONG THEIR MEMBERS. SOME OF THOSE DOCUMENTS AND REPORTS HAVE BEEN SEIZED FROM BOYS WHO WERE ARRESTED ON CHARGES OF BEING DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN LOOTING OF COMMERCIAL PREMISES AND IN THE BLOODY MURDERS OF CARABINEROS PERSONNEL.</p><p>SOME OF THOSE DOCUMENTS SAY THAT "SOCIALIST COUNTRIES ARE OUR STRATEGIC ALLIES," AND THAT THE MOVEMENTS IDENTIFY THEMSELVES WITH "THE REVOLUTIONARY FORM OF STRUGGLE AND WITH THE STRUGGLE IN THE TRENCHES THAT CUBA, NICARAGUA, AND EL SALVADOR HAVE USED" TO REMAIN IN THE FOREFRONT OF LATIN AMERICAN SOCIALISM.</p><p>THE TWO TERRORIST MOVEMENTS MAINTAIN THAT "SEIZURE" OF LAND, LOOTINGS, OCCUPATION OF EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, AND "THE RECOVERY OF FIREARMS" ARE THE MAIN TACTICS TO BE UNDERTAKEN BY THE MASSES IN ORDER TO "GAIN ELBOW ROOM."</p><p>IN THE DOCUMENTS, THE MOVEMENTS ADVOCATE THE DISSEMINATION OF VIOLENCE WITHIN THE MASSES, THE ADOPTION OF DEFENSIVE MEASURES IN ORDER TO BEGIN AN OFFENSIVE, AND "A WAR BY EVERYONE" AS AN INEVITABLE STEP FOR TAKING OVER THE COUNTRY.</p><p>THE MOVEMENTS MAINTAIN THAT "THE FACT THAT THE REBEL ELEMENTS HAVE DISCOVERED THEIR OWN GEOGRAPHICAL ZONE, THE POWER OF THE MASSES, AND THE MASSIVE POTENTIAL OF YOUTHS, IS ONE OF THE MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT."</p><p>THE DOCUMENTS EMPHASIZE THE TERRORIST ACTIONS PERFORMED BY THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT [FPMR] AND BY THE MOVEMENT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY LEFT [MIR], STRESSING THAT THE MJL AND THE FRPL ARE THE TWO OTHER CHILEAN EXTREMIST ORGANIZATIONS THAT "IMPLEMENT THE POLICY OF THE VICTORY OF THE PEOPLE'S REVOLUTION."</p><p>AS FOR THE SO-CALLED "WAR BY EVERYONE," THE DOCUMENTS POINTS OUT THAT "IN THE CHILEAN VERSION, THERE ARE IRREGULAR FORCES WITH TRAINING IN SUBVERSIVE TACTICS AND STRATEGY."</p><p>THE MOVEMENTS MAINTAIN THAT THEIR MEMBERS OPERATE IN THE STREETS, IN EDUCATION AND LABOR CENTERS, IN HIGH SCHOOLS, AND IN SHANTYTOWNS, ADDING THAT "THE TACTICAL SEQUENCE OF ACTION AMONG THE MASSES SHOULD BEGIN AND END WITH POPULAR UPRISINGS, WHICH LEAD TO A HIGHER STAGE OF TRANSITION TOWARD "THE PEOPLE IN FLAMES" OR "THE PEOPLE IN ARMS."</p><p>THE MOVEMENTS ADMIT THAT "THE ART OF REVOLUTION CONSISTS OF AWAKENING THE AMBITION FOR POWER BY TEACHING THE MASSES TO DREAM OF SOMETHING ELSE."</p><p>ANOTHER PARAGRAPH OF THE LENGTHY DOCUMENTS STATES THAT: "WE DO NOT DENY THE NEED TO REACH POLITICAL ACCORDS", WHICH WE -- AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE --COMPLY WITH, BECAUSE "THE OBJECTIVE IS TO ADOPT A POSITION OF INDEPENDENCE AND OF INITIATIVE IN THE OFFENSIVE, BECAUSE THE REVOLUTIONS ARE FOUGHT IN THE STREETS AND IN THE DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY."</p><p>CONCERNING THE CREATION OF THE TWO MOVEMENTS (BEGINNING IN 1983), THE DOCUMENTS STATE THAT "OUR POLITICAL-MILITARY PROPOSAL TAKES ROOT IN THE "WAR BY EVERYONE," A SYSTEM WHICH SOCIALIST COUNTRIES AND TRIUMPHANT REVOLUTIONS HAVE USED TO DEFEND THEMSELVES FROM IMPERIALISM. THE MOST INTENSE EXPRESSION OF THIS POLICY HAS BEEN REFLECTED BY THE VIETNAMESE REVOLUTION, BY THE SUSTAINED STRUGGLE IN EL SALVADOR, AND BY THE RESISTANCE TO THE SPANISH INVASION BY THE MAPUCHE PEOPLE, UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF LAUTARO.</p><p>HOW TO OBTAIN WEAPONS</p><p>IN A DOCUMENT DEALING WITH THE "REVOLTIONARY PROGRAM FOR CHILE," THE MOVEMENTS CLAIM THAT "OUR WEAPONS ARE OBTAINED THROUGH THE PEOPLE'S INITIATIVE, THROUGH WEAPON SEIZURES FROM THE ENEMY (THIS IS A CLEAR ALLUSION TO THE MURDER OF CARABINEROS, WHOSE ARMS THEY SEIZE), AND THROUGH INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY."</p><p>THE DOCUMENTS EMPHASIZE "THE OFFENSIVE WAR WHICH WE ARE NOW WAGING SEEKS TO ASPHYXIATE THE ENEMY, OVERWHELM IT, AND IMPEDE ITS INITIATIVE AND THE CONCENTRATION OF ITS FORCES. WE SHOULD ALWAYS TRY TO CAUSE AS MUCH DESTRUCTIVE DAMAGE TO THE ENEMY AS POSSIBLE."</p><p>THE TERRORISTS CALL ON "YOUTHS TO WAGE THIS REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE ON A NATIONWIDE BASIS," ADDING THAT "EVEN THOUGH THE HEAVIEST BURDEN RESTS ON THE CITIES, THE COUNTRY AND RURAL AREAS ARE CONDUCIVE TO THE INSTALLATION OF STRATEGIC FACILITIES."</p><p>THE REPORT ON THE FIRST NATIONAL PLENUM (WHICH IS DATED MAY 1989) HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY DEDICATED TO "ALL HIGH SCHOOL AND MID-LEVEL STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN RECRUITED BY OUR GROUPS."</p><p>AMONG THE SLOGANS INCLUDED IN THE DOCUMENTS, WHICH THE LAUTARO MOVEMENT MEMBERS WILL USE THIS YEAR, ARE PHRASES LIKE "WE ARE A NEW REVOLUTIONARY GENERATION," "WE ARE HAPPY, WE ARE REBEL, WE ARE ARMED, AND THIS IS HOW WE WILL CARRY OUT THE REVOLUTION," "THE FATHERLAND FOR THE PEOPLE," AND "FREE LOVE AND GUERRILLA."</p><p>AFTER OUTLINING THE EIGHT TACTICAL OPERATIONS WHICH MAKE UP "THE REVOLUTIONARY COURSE FOR THE MASSES WHO WILL FACE THE POLITICAL BREAK" DURING THE REST OF THE YEAR, THE TWO MOVEMENTS STATE THAT "WE TOTAL APPROXIMATELY 500,000 ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, AND SINCE 1983 WE HAVE FOUGHT IN MORE THAN 30 TERRITORIES AND FRONTS."</p><p>FINALLY, AS PART OF A SERIES OF CLEAR TERRORIST INSTRUCTIONS, THEY CLAIM THAT THEY WORK "IN COORDINATION WITH THE FPMR AND WITH THE MIR,"SO THAT "WITH THE YOUTH, THE PEOPLE, THE ARMS, AND THE IDEAS, WE MAY TAKE OVER CHILE."</p></body></html>
