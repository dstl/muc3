THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, THROUGH ITS INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, HAS BEEN BRAZENLY MANEUVERING SO THAT THE ELECTIONS WILL BE FAVORABLE TO THE EMPIRE'S INTERESTS IN CENTRAL AMERICA. BESIDES ITS INTELLIGENCE SERVICES, THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS MAINTAINED A TEAM DEDICATED TO ELECTORAL TERRORISM TO SERVE THE OPPOSITION SECTORS IN HANDLING CAMPAIGN PROPAGANDA, DISTRIBUTING MONEY, AND FALSIFYING AND STEALING TALLY SHEETS. THESE TERRORIST AGENTS BELIEVE THAT THEIR EXPERIENCE IN PANAMA, WHERE THEY CLAIM THEY WERE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL, CAN BE APPLIED TO NICARAGUA.</p><p>AS A FIRST STEP TOWARD PROCLAIMING U.S. INTERVENTION IN THE FEBRUARY ELECTIONS IN NICARAGUA, PRESIDENT BUSH IS "CONSIDERING" MAKING AN INITIAL DONATION OF $3 MILLION TO THE OPPOSITION. THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS ALLEGEDLY SAID THAT "PRESIDENT BUSH HAS BEEN CONSIDERING RESORTING TO THE CIA TO CONTROL THE NICARAGUAN ELECTIONS AND TO DISTRIBUTE MONEY TO OPPOSITION PARTY LEADERS."</p><p>ACCORDING TO THE SAME SOURCE, PRESIDENT BUSH IS NOT DISCARDING THE USE OF THE SO-CALLED "CONTRAS" TO HARASS THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT FROM HONDURAS TO CREATE CHAOS DURING THE ELECTIONS, GIVING THE UNITED STATES AN EXCUSE TO OCCUPY NICARAGUA MILITARILY."</p><p>ACCORDING TO CONTINENTAL OBSERVERS, PRESIDENT BUSH HAS DECIDED "THAT THE NICARGUAN ELECTIONS MUST BE WON BY THE UNITED STATES."</p><p>VIOLETA DE CHAMORRO'S CANDIDACY IS A SIMPLE COVER-UP, THE SAME AS THE CANDIDACY LAUNCHED BY THE SECTORS THAT OPPOSE OUR COUNTRY'S CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT.</p><p>ANY ANALYST CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT "THE UNITED STATES IS NOT GOING TO TAKE ITS HANDS OFF CENTRAL AMERICA." THAT IS WHY WASHINGTON IS SEEKING FORMULAS TO SEND MONEY TO THE OPPOSITION, NOT ONLY LEGALLY, BUT ALSO THROUGH ILLEGAL CHANNELS AND PHANTOM ORGANIZATIONS, WHICH, UNDER THE EXCUSE OF "DEFENDING DEMOCRACY" OPERATE IN AFGHANISTAN, ANGOLA, AND THE MIDDLE EAST; SUPPORT APARTHEID IN SOUTH AFRICA; AND ENGAGE IN OTHER TERRORIST ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.</p><p>PRESIDENT BUSH HAS SAID THAT "THE FEBRUARY ELECTIONS IN NICARAGUA ARE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUT AN END TO THE MARXIST GOVERNMENT IN NICARAGUA HEADED BY DANIEL ORTEGA." ACCORDING TO ANALYSTS, "THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS READY TO SPEND AT LEAST $200 MILLION TO WIN THE ELECTIONS IN NICARAGUA." IT IS ALSO READY TO EXPAND SANCTIONS AGAINST THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT, THEREBY INCREASING DESPERATION, BECAUSE IT BELIEVES THAT THE PEOPLE'S DESPERATION, MISERY, HUNGER, AND DEATHS MIGHT PRODUCE A REBELLION FAVORABLE TO U.S. INTERESTS."</p></body></html>
